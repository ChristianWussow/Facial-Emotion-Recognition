# <center>Computer Vision: Facial Emotion Categorization<center>
#### We take the FAR2013 dataset to calssify 7 different emotions from  facial pictures. The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). The training set consists of 28,709 examples and the public test set consists of 7178 examples.
